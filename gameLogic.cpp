/*
This class should take care of things like;
deciding if a move is valid,
	- Stone already there
	- Suicide move
	- ko move (illegal recapture)
	- etc
translate a mouseclick to a real place on the board,
deciding if one or a group of stones are dead,
Count points when game is over, (this is quite difficult) because I think many programs
have AI that plays until there are no more moves
possible and calculates like that. But an easy way would be to just have the player mark dead
stones for themselves and if something is missing
they have to continue playing and fill in some stones.
